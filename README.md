This app will collect the url, after the "localhost:8080", then split it on the /, and will not accept blank space. After collecting the parts, there are 4 strings that will produce non-404 ouputs:

"lipsums" will show the other three strings available for input, and suggest that the user chooses one.

"kotor", "lotr", and "hodor" each return a longer string through the localhost.
